Project 6 - 
Description: The purpose of this project is to create and test JavaScript classes for shapes, including a base Shape class, a Rectangle class, and a Triangle class. The classes inherit from the Shape class and provide functionality for calculating the perimeter and area of shapes.

Lab 7 -
Description: The purpose of this project is to familiarize students with GitHub and Git version control system by creating a GitHub organization, repository, and performing basic Git operations such as cloning, committing, and pushing changes. It also introduces error handling in JavaScript through the implementation of try-catch blocks and custom error classes.

Lab 8 -
Description: This lab aims to familiarize you with Node.js, Fastify, and the node-fetch package. You'll create a Node.js folder, install dependencies, implement Fastify routes, and use node-fetch to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API. The lab file will include routes for retrieving all photos and a single photo, handling Promises, and returning relevant status codes and data.

Lab 9 -
Description: The purpose of this project is to create a release based workflow using GitHub Learning Lab. It involves creating a course repo, working through the course steps, and downloading the completed course repo as a deliverable.

Project 7 -
Description: The purpose of this project is to create an initial CIT Minor portfolio using GitHub Pages. It involves creating a main GitHub Page with a list of labs and projects, creating separate repos for each lab and project, enabling GitHub Pages for each repo with descriptions and images, and documenting the GitHub Page URL.
