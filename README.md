Project 2 - 
Description: The purpose of this project is to practice using git and refactoring JavaScript code. It involves creating a git repository, refactoring a JavaScript program by isolating code into functions and eliminating global variables, and using function expressions.

Lab 3 - 
Description: This lab aims to improve JavaScript skills by practicing modern syntax, object destructuring, arrow functions, loop syntax, and creating/importing code modules for Node.js.

Project 3 -
Description: This project involves creating a JavaScript code module for coin calculations and a web server using Node.js and Fastify to serve those calculations. It also includes an index.html file for the web page interface and routes for different coin calculations.

Lab 4 - 
Description: This project aims to create a Fastify Node.js web server that handles different routes and query parameters, providing web content based on the requested URLs. The goal is to learn and practice web server development using Fastify and Node.js.

Project 4 -
Description: The project involves creating a REST API that interacts with a data source containing questions and answers. It requires implementing code modules and routes to handle various operations on data, such as retrieving specific questions or answers and testing the functionality using tools like Postman.

Lab 5 -
Description: The purpose of this project is to develop a Node.js and Fastify server application that handles GET and POST requests, allowing interaction with a collection of data.

Lab 6 -
Description: The purpose of this project is to create JavaScript classes for a digital book library. The classes allow for the creation, management, and deletion of books within the library.

Project 6 - 
Description: The purpose of this project is to create and test JavaScript classes for shapes, including a base Shape class, a Rectangle class, and a Triangle class. The classes inherit from the Shape class and provide functionality for calculating the perimeter and area of shapes.

Lab 7 -
Description: The purpose of this project is to familiarize students with GitHub and Git version control system by creating a GitHub organization, repository, and performing basic Git operations such as cloning, committing, and pushing changes. It also introduces error handling in JavaScript through the implementation of try-catch blocks and custom error classes.

Lab 8 -
Description: This lab aims to familiarize you with Node.js, Fastify, and the node-fetch package. You'll create a Node.js folder, install dependencies, implement Fastify routes, and use node-fetch to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API. The lab file will include routes for retrieving all photos and a single photo, handling Promises, and returning relevant status codes and data.

Lab 9 - https://github.com/nikhilshah6/skills-release-based-workflow.git

Description: The purpose of this project is to create a release based workflow using GitHub Learning Lab. It involves creating a course repo, working through the course steps, and downloading the completed course repo as a deliverable.

Project 7 -
Description: The purpose of this project is to create an initial CIT Minor portfolio using GitHub Pages. It involves creating a main GitHub Page with a list of labs and projects, creating separate repos for each lab and project, enabling GitHub Pages for each repo with descriptions and images, and documenting the GitHub Page URL.
